# Hardware In Loop Simulation
Hardware in the loop simulation is tested with webots, but x-plane support is 
planned as well. To do so, you need to have [aerobridge](https://github.com/koerolabs/aerobridge) 
on your machine and follow the steps detailed there. You then need to load the 
aeronode firmware onto your board with debug mode enabled. It uses usb for all 
sensor inputs and command outputs. Some better way would be figured out for this 
in due course.
